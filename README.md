> **Supermarket navigation for blind or visually impaired people**

**Description**

- It is designed as part of an honours project. Eye Oculus project aims to design prototypes for blind or visually impaired people
- Users can scan different QR codes placed in the supermarket and then app directs them to appropriate pages
- The android app navigates users according to the fixed supermarket map in the photo above for now. In the future, I am planning to create a platform. In this platform, markets can upload their maps and app can be used for many markets
